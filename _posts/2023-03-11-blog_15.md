## Overview:

This week we carried out a code review with our client - reiterating our achievements, reffering back to our agreen MoSCoW requirements, and explaining the quality and process of our implementation. We also continued testing our application. We also dockerized our application and packaged it as a desktop application as another option for our client when they wish to deploy it on their own local network.

## Code Review:

Below, are some slides we presented to our clients:

## Testing:

We utilised `Jest` as our testing framework as it is a popular testing library which is easy to use for React and has thorough documentation. A snapshot of our frontend tests is included below, in which we tested the main components of our web application.

## Application:

### Desktop Version

We used 'Electron', to easily convert our web application into an equivalent and easy to use desktop app; giving our client a flexibile decsion of how they wish to deploy it. It runs exactly the same as it does when running on the web in localhost, as seen below:

### Docker

We decided to use docker, as it makes sharing, and running containerized applications easy and accessible to our client. Minimising the complexity in having to start up and use the application locally.

## Next steps:

Before handing over our project, we will finalise our testing, create a user & deployment manual and update all readMe files on each of our GitHub repositories. Next week we will also be focussing on on our project website.
