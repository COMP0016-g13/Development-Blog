## Overview:

This week we asked for some clarification regarding the tables and certain common fields/values our client had provided in the database. They then provided a spreadsheet explaining all tables, fields and values. We also shared our initial profiling ideas for feedback.

## Databse:

Our client provided a spreadsheet explaining the overview of each table as well as a description of what each column and its values mean:

## Profiling Ideas:

#### Idea 1

Categorise the different descriptions of all communications sent e.g.

![profile idea](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog8/profile.png)

i.e. For each donor:

- Assign a category to it (the most frequently attended type of event or other patterns)
- Assign the most likely communication response: mail, letter, newsletter etc. (based off contacts_sent_and_donation_received and mapping this to method_description in contacts table)

#### Other Ideas

- By amount donated
- By location for income
- By frequency of donations
- By reason to donate or participate in events (e.g. bereavement)

## Next Steps:

We will now spend the Christmas break, trying to implement an initial prototype for our application - completing our data analysis and beginning to implement our profiles.
