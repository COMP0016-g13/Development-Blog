## Overview:

This week we began the development of our application: starting with the front & back-end of authentication and the home page.

## Login:

User authentication is essential, as the application is handling personal data of the hospice's donors.

We are utilising the libraries: `msal` and `flask_session` for our login. `msal` is a Microsoft authentication library and we are using it because the database is hosted on a Microsoft sal server. In the prior week, when carrying out data analysis - we utilised the login details of the Microsoft accounts that our clients had provided us with in order to query a view the tables within the database. As a result, we believed it would be more efficient and beneficial to utilise this same authentication technique for accessing the application as our client could then add new accounts for users to access it.

## Home Page, Donor List and Filtering:

The next stage we implemented was the donor list on the front home page. This will show a list of all donors in the hospice's database. This will allow us to quickly select and search for specific donors from this page in order to view donor journeys. This was a simple query from the clients `donor_register` table which is then passed to our react frontend to be displayed.

The next iteration of this feature, was to allow filtering for easy access and search capabilities of this large dataset. Our main ideas were to either filter by intervals (e.g. 0-10, 10-100) or by exact values. However, we quickly realised, that for many columns there were too many unique values which ended up taking a large amount of time to load and thus slowed down the application. We therefore resulted in an alternative approach of allowing the user to enter a min and max value to display the list of donors who would fit in this interval (this also had the advantage of saving us time of not having to identify suitable intervals ourselves).

## Next Steps:

We will continue to develop our application, and as we are going into our first week back from the Christmas break, we will begin to plan and present the work we have completed so far to our client while also preparing for our upcoming elevator pitch.
