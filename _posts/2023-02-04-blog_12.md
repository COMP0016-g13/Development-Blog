title: "Week 17 & 18 - Profile Improvements"

## Overview:

For these past 2 weeks we continued working on our profiles based off of the feedback we had gained form our clients. Particularly focussing on RFM values of donors in the last 5 years.

## RFM process:

RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary) scores were assigned to donors who had made at least 1 donation in the last 5 years. Higher scores for Frequency & Monetary and lower score for Recency would signify the most valuable donors (A lower Recency score signifies the donor's last donation was a short time away).

Profile Ideas:

- By assigning these scores alone, we could create profiles by identifying and separating donors who are the most valuable in each individual category of RFM as well as for all 3 i.e. the most valuable donors
- We can also pass these scores as well as other features into a k-means algorithm, in order to identify any other patterns that can be seen

#### Results:

Below is an example of the results obtained, having assigned the RFM values (as described in the process above) to each donor and then passing these trough our k-means algorithm:

As well as the above, we began looking through the first few sources of each donor, in order to identify the typical journey donors go through (in regards to donation source groups) and are results are as follows:

It can be seen that a donors subsequent donation from their source donation is typically of the same source group. e.g. the first bar plot is 'Event -CT/DD, Event -CT/DD, Event -CT/DD' which means the donors in this plot have their first 3 donation source groups as 'Event -CT/DD'. And this can be seen as the case fro majority of donors.

## Feedback:

Our client had found this a much bigger improvement to the profiles we had previously created and would now like us to focus on a few specific donor sources explained below.

Within the field 'Source Group', the following items:

- [Tribute, Clinical] as 'In Memory Of'
- [Collecting, FRL, CAM] as 'Community'
- Raffle
- Donation as 'Cash Donor'

Within the field 'Income Stream', the following items can be focused on.

- [Regular Giving, Payroll Giving] as 'Regular Giving'

Reducing the features to focus on the 5 above will greatly improve the results produced by k-means clustering and should help us to produce
more profiles.

## Application:

While continuously improving on the data analysis aspect, we have also continued implementing features into our main application. We have successfully added visualisation tool for donation journeys via a donor map:

## Next steps:

We will use the specified donor sources provided by our clients, to start creating and researching into building a model for predictions while also finalising and implementing the profiles found into our application.
