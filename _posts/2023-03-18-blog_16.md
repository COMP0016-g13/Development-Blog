## Overview:

This week we have been working on completing all documentation for our project, as shown on our [project website](http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2022/group13/). We have uploaded important documents regarding legal issues as well as our user manual. We have prepared our slides and agreed on the content we wish to discuss in our final technical presentation as well as begun preparation for our final non-technical pitch.

## Next steps:

For our final week, we will be reviewing our portfolio site, checking all content is correctly covered, as well as complete handover of our project with our client. We will then record and edit our final videos and submit all required material for the module.
