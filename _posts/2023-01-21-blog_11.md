## Overview:

For the last 2 weeks we shared and recapped over the progress we made during the winter break and presented this to our client. We also prepared and presented our elevator pitch

## Feedback:

Below are the profiles we had identified:

![Contacts Profile 1](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog11/contacts1.png)
![Contacts Profile 2](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog11/contacts2.png)

![Donors Monetary](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog11/donors_monetary.png)
![Donors eval](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog11/donors.png)

Our client had stated they didn't believe they would be able to identify any specific clusters from these. We will therefore reconsider the features we included before passing into our K-means algorithm in order to find more specific profiles

## RFM findings:

We also carried out RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on the data - trying to identify whether or not donors would consistently follow a path similar to their source donation which we found to be the case.

## Next Steps:

Having received constructive feedback from our client, we will continue working on our profiles; revising of the features we decided to include prior to carrying out our k-means analysis
