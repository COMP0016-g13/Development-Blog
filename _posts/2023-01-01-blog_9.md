title: "Week 12 & 13 - Data Cleaning, PCA & K-Means Clustering"
date: 2023-12-11

## Overview:

This week we began cleaning our data, carrying out data dimension reduction (via PCA) as well as K-means clustering to identify different profiles

## Data Cleaning:

Below is an brief summary of how we cleaned the data. We performed each of these stages (where necessary) on all the tables our client had provided:

1. Brief look over head of each table
2. Find the proportion of missing data, checked datatypes of each column & removed any potential whitespaces
3. Dealt with missing data appropriately
4. Any necessary feature engineering (feature selection/extraction)
5. Checked unique values in essential columns
