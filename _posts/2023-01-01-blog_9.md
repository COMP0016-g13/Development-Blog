title: "Week 12 & 13 - Data Cleaning, PCA & K-Means Clustering"
date: 2023-12-11

## Overview:

This week we began cleaning our data, carrying out data dimension reduction (via PCA) as well as K-means clustering to identify different profiles

## Data Cleaning:

Below is an brief summary of how we cleaned the data. We performed each of these stages (where necessary) on all the tables our client had provided:

1. Brief look over head of each table
2. Find the proportion of missing data, checked datatypes of each column & removed any potential whitespaces
3. Dealt with missing data appropriately
4. Any necessary feature engineering (feature selection/extraction)
5. Checked unique values in essential columns

## Identifying tables to be joined & passed through PCA/K-means:

1. Communications (combining: contacts, conctacts_sent & contacts_sent_and_donation_received) which produced the following table:

![Communications table](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog9/table1.png)

This should hopefully produce any insights into groups of people who respond to similar events (and perhaps at specific times)
NOTE: we are not including 'donor_communications' as it contains ~38,000 unique communication references making these difficult to group.

2. Individual Donors (combining: donor_register, donations, & donor_distance_from_hospice) which produced the following table

![Donors table](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog9/table2.png)

We are hoping to find groups of donors with similar attributes e.g. donors who perhaps have the same source group, similar category's and perhaps donate similar amounts.

## Feature Engineering:

Although feature selection had been completed at the cleaning stage, it was imperative that we also carried out feature transformation, particularly, discretisation (representing a quantity with a numerical value) on each of the categorical data columns we wanted to visualise

- e.g. we replaced the different categorise for source_group with their own columns (i.e. 'Appeal Christmas' and 'Lottery' were each separated and had a 0 or 1 in the field to represent if this was the event being sent etc.)

## PCA:

Before carrying out K-means clustering, we must first reduce the feature set to be small enough as to contain the greatest amount of variance of the data in as small a feature set as possible. We did so in the following steps:

1. Standardising all numerical fields to have a mean of ~0 and a variance of 1
2. Identify an appropriate feature set number to reduce our dimensions to:

- Above figure clearly shows that the first 3 components explain majority of the data.

3. We then wanted to visualise if there were any clear clusters that could be seen in the first two components and this yielded the following graph:

![pca_cluster]](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog9/pca_cluster.png)

- This shows there are at least 2-3 distinguishable clusters here

## K-Means Clustering:

1. needed to determine the best number of clusters to use on our top 3 PCA components. Thus plotted a graph of inertia (indicates the % of variance being explained) against the number of clusters and we obtained the following result:

![kmeans_inertia]](/Development-Blog/assets/Blog9/kmeans_inertia.png)

- The elbow point of the curve is at 4 clusters therefore indicating that the change of inertia, and hence the variance, after this point is insignificant.

2. We could now proceed to passing our data into the k-means algorithm; first we performed PCA on our chosen number of components, 3, and then ran K-means using the aforementioned 4 clusters and fitting this with our PCA model.
3. added the PCA scores (from each of the 3 components) as well as the assigned clusters to each row i.e.:

4. Visualise the data :

## Next Steps:

For our final week, we will now look into: identifying the characteristics of the individuals within these two groups, start building our application and begin prepping to share our results with our clients as well as planning for our elevator pitch.
