## Next Steps:

Moving forward, we will also begin to think about how we would like to implement our proposed solution I.e. languages and frameworks etc.

Below is a list of ideas we have brainstormed:

### desktop application:

    electron - react
    qt - c++
    xamarin - c#
    flutter - dart

### web:

    #### front-end:
        vue
        angular
        react
    #### back-end: (python based framework is probably best for data analysis)
        django (python)
        flask (python)
        node (javascript)
        spring (java)
