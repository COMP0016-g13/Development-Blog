## Overview:

We have completed our literature review and shared our initial research with our clients.

## Research Papers:

We we able to find research carried out in this data science filed related to fundraising and gathered the below information:

## Data Science Terminology:

In order to help prepare us for our implementation - we also carried out research around key data science tools. e.g:

- Due to the fact that the data may have a large amount of dimensions, our k-means clustering may not be as effective at distinguishing between examples (because of the 'Curse of Dimensionality'). Thus we would either make use of PCA, or spectral clustering before we use our k-means clustering algorithm to reduce the dimensions of our data.

## Next steps:

We will now present our literature review to our TA in order to gather feedback and work on any improvements as necessary. We will also begin to think about identifying key checkpoints in our frontend and backend development in order to begin our implementation as well as update our Gantt chart.
