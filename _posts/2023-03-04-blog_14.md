## Overview:

We have now added our prediction model into our application and shared this prototype with our client for feedback. We have also begun our testing stage; carrying out extensive test on all our frontend components as well as checking over our data analysis.

## Predicitons:

Below is the process and accuracy result for our prediction models. We utilised `random forest classification` in order to predict the following:

1. Next source of donation
2. Next likely date for donation
3. Next donation amount

### 1) Next source of donation:

## Next steps:

Our client was extremely happy with our progress. We will now continue finishing our tests, beginning to create our user/deployment manuals as well as preparing for our final meeting next week in which we will carry out our code review and the project handover.
