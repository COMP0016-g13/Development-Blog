## Overview:

We have now added our prediction model into our application and shared this prototype with our client for feedback. We have also begun our testing stage; carrying out extensive test on all our frontend components as well as checking over our data analysis.

## Predicitons:

Below is the process and accuracy result for our prediction models. We utilised `random forest classification` in order to predict the following:

1. Next source of donation
2. Next likely date for donation
3. Next donation amount

### 1) Next source of donation:

### 2) Next likely date for donation:

### 3) Next donation amount

## Application Improvements:

### Updated Donor Map:

Our client had requested to emphasise points which contained the highest donations made within a donors journey. The last images show the result of our update in which this donor donated the most in 2017 and therefore, this point is larger to emphasise this matter. The emphasis is in respect to the number of points e.g. a year with 100 donations will not be overly emphasised with respect to other donors but rather against its respective donations other yearly donations.

### Donor Profiles:

Our application now clearly shows the profiles (if any), a donor is assigned to (_see images below_). When selected, this will transfer the user to the specific profile page for more information.

### Donor Predictions:

We have now implemented the prediction for each donor, within each donors page. Clearly identifying the predictions for the next: date, amount and donation source (_see images below_).

### Donor Communication:

For ease of access and quick information, we also decided to include the communications made to a donor as well as whether they responded or not (_see images below_).

## Next steps:

Our client was extremely happy with our progress. We will now continue finishing our tests, beginning to create our user/deployment manuals as well as preparing for our final meeting next week in which we will carry out our code review and the project handover.
