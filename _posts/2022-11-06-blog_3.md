## Overview:

This week we shared out initial prototype with our client and went over our MoSCoW draft for confirmation and feedback as well as continued working on finishing our HCI report for the first assignment of the module

## Initial Prototype:

Based off of sketch 2, we were able to implement a prototype in Figma:

The client and users were pleased with this initial mockup however raised a few suggestions. (Improvements can be seen below)

## Heuristic Evaluation:

Below is a Heuristic Evaluation which revealed the feedback we received alongside possible solutions:

## Final Prototype:

Based on the evaluation, we made the following changes:

- Made the touchpoint larger - for easier access
- Cursor changes when hovering over a single user, to show it’s a link
- A new page to allow for easier access to list of users who are most likely to respond to a given list

## Next Steps

We will now utilise the following days to put all the work we have completed to date together and submit our HCI report and finalise our MoSCoW requirements.
