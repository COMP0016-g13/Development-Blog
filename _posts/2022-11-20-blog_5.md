## Overview:

This week we began working on our literature review: researching essential topics within the data science sector, researching other examples projects/ state of the art work as well as deciding the tech stack we will implement.

## Tech Stack:

As we decided to create a web based application, we began researching on some possible languages and technology to implement our platform, considering: ease of use, our prior experiences and the availability of public libraries. Initial languages included: Vue, Angular and React (JS/TS) for Frontend and for backend: R and Python (FastAPI, Flask and Django).

After thorough research and reflection upon our requirements, we had decided with:

- Frontend: React (Typescript)
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- DB: Microsoft SQL

## Reasoning:

React - Majority of the team is familiar with this framework and due to its popularity, there are a multitude of resources available to assist us in explaining certain concepts[1]. . In addition to this it contains useful tools such as hooks to manage application state[2].

Python - it is currently the most widely used programming language for data science [3] and particularly the framework Flask because it allows unit testing, is lightweight and beginner-friendly [4]

Microsoft SQL - as this is the database system our client had provided us access with

## Libraries:

For analysing and manipulating data, we chose Pandas module, as it works best with the tabular data we will be working with. we also considered Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. However, unlike Seaborn, Matplotlib cannot visualize Pandas dataframes [5]. Hence, why we are deciding to use Seaborn.

#### Main features:

- Allows users to conveniently clean the data so it is ready to be put into a model
- Create models through visual or code based approaches
- Manage the models very easily (For example, make new models, delete models, update them etc.)

Even though this project differs from ours, we can take some ideas from their implementation - they have used a simple user interface to display the data once it has been analysed by a particular model.

## Next steps:

We will continue working on our literature review - researching more into data science tools as well as past research papers carried out in this field and finally present our research to our clients for review.
