title: "Week 19 & 20 - Implementing Profiles"

## Overview:

Over the reading week, we have been adding the profiles found, into our application (having also carried out further analysis) as well as
carried further research to prepare us before developing a model for predictions.

## Application Profiles:

Below is an example of a profile identified from our k-means algorithm. We focused on the 5 specific 'Source Group' values as requested by client, in order to help reduce the feature set of our tables when passing into a k-means algorithm:

For the above profile, we can clearly describe donors assigned within here as those who aren't within the 5 specified 'source groups' and those who typically attend draw & winter events.

We will use the above process, to continue assigning a description to all our identified profiles.

## Next steps:

We will spend next week, finalising all our analysis and application code, making sure to finalise all functionality and clean all code as well as implement a model for our predictions; having carried out extensive research.
